# PP-MITM-Shield
  
**PP-MITM-Shield** is a multi-layer protection tool against Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks  
for Linux systems (tested on Red Hat-based distributions).  
It provides real-time detection and active blocking of suspicious traffic across multiple protocols,  
preventing ARP spoofing, DNS poisoning, DHCP attacks, SSL stripping, ICMP redirects, rogue AP connections,  
and broadcast poisoning.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Modular Protection Architecture** – Each protection mechanism is implemented as a separate Python module for clarity and maintainability.
- **Real-Time Detection** – Continuous packet inspection using `scapy` with minimal overhead.
- **Automatic Mitigation** – Offending hosts are blocked instantly via `iptables`.
- **Learning Mode** – Allows building **whitelists** of legitimate hosts before enabling protection.
- **Interactive CLI** – Easy-to-use text menu to start individual modules or all at once.
- **Logging & Monitoring** – All alerts and actions are logged for audit and analysis.

## 🛡️ Protection Modules

| Module | Protocols / Techniques Covered | Description |
|--------|---------------------------------|-------------|
| **ARP Protection** | ARP | Detects ARP spoofing / poisoning by comparing incoming ARP replies with the trusted table. |
| **DNS Protection** | DNS | Detects forged DNS responses that redirect to malicious IP addresses. |
| **DHCP Protection** | DHCP | Detects rogue DHCP servers trying to assign malicious configurations. |
| **SSL-Strip Detection** | HTTP / HTTPS | Detects attempts to downgrade HTTPS connections to HTTP. |
| **Rogue-AP Detection** | 802.11 / Wi-Fi | Detects unauthorized access points mimicking legitimate SSIDs. |
| **Broadcast-Poison Protection** | LLMNR, NBNS, mDNS, WS-Discovery | Detects spoofed broadcast/multicast name resolutions and service discovery packets. |
| **ICMP Redirect Protection** | ICMP Redirect | Detects and blocks forged ICMP redirect messages attempting to change routing. |
| **HTTPS→HTTP Redirect Watcher** | HTTP 3xx Responses | Detects redirections from secure to insecure protocols. |

## 📦 Installation & Dependencies (Red Hat / CentOS / Rocky / AlmaLinux)

PP‑MITM‑Shield requires Python 3 and several libraries/tools to operate.
Below are the tested dependencies and installation commands for Red Hat–based systems.

### 1️⃣ Update system
```bash
sudo dnf update -y
```

### 2️⃣ Install required system packages
```bash
sudo dnf install -y \
  python3 python3-pip \
  iptables iproute \
  git
```
> Notes  
> - On EL8/EL9, `iptables` is the nftables shim and works fine with this project.  
> - SELinux may stay Enforcing; the tool only sniffs traffic and manages host firewall rules.

### 3️⃣ (Recommended) Create a Python virtual environment
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

### 4️⃣ Python libraries
Minimal dependency set is **Scapy**.
```bash
pip install --upgrade scapy
```

If you prefer a requirements file, add:
```text
scapy>=2.5.0
```
and install with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5️⃣ Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pavel-P09/PP-MITM-Shield.git
cd PP-MITM-Shield
```

### 6️⃣ (Optional) Make scripts executable
```bash
chmod +x *.py
```

### 7️⃣ Run the tool
```bash
sudo python3 main.py
```
> Run with `sudo` to enable raw‑socket capture and automatic firewall blocking.

### 🔧 Optional utilities for lab diagnostics (not required for protection)
```bash
sudo dnf install -y tcpdump
```

### ✅ Verified environment
- OS: Rocky Linux 9 / AlmaLinux 9 / CentOS Stream 9 (EL9)
- Kernel: 5.x (EL9)
- Python: 3.9+


### Menu Structure
1. **Learning / Lists / Firewall / Logs** – Manage whitelists, blacklists, view logs, clear firewall rules.
2. **Protection & Monitoring Modules** – Start/stop individual protections or all at once.
3. **Exit** – Quit the tool.

### Starting All Protections
From the **Protection & Monitoring Modules** menu:
```
[9] Start All Protections
```
You will be prompted for:
- **Interface** – Press Enter for all interfaces or type one (e.g., `enp0s3`).
- **Broadcast-Poison: Monitor ALL UDP ports?** – `y` for all UDP traffic, `n` for standard ports only.

---

## 📑 Logging

- All detections and blocks are logged in `logs/`.
- Each module writes its own log file for easier analysis.
- Logs are plain text and can be rotated or parsed by external tools.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Packet Capture** – Each module listens for its protocol(s) using `scapy` BPF filters.
2. **Validation** – Incoming packets are analyzed against learned whitelists and expected patterns.
3. **Detection** – If a packet violates trusted rules, it is flagged as malicious.
4. **Mitigation** – Offender’s IP/MAC is blocked instantly via `iptables`.
5. **Alerting** – Event is logged with timestamp, type, offending host, and mitigation action.

---

## 📌 Notes

- Best used **after learning mode** to avoid blocking legitimate devices.
- Designed for **host-level protection** – does not replace a perimeter firewall.
- All modules can be extended to support new attack vectors.
